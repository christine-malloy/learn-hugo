Once you have chosen a theme for your Hugo site, you'll likely want to customize it to match your brand or personal style. This post covers the basics of theme customization.

## Understanding Theme Structure

Before making changes, it's important to understand the structure of Hugo themes:

- **layouts**: Contains HTML templates
- **static**: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **assets**: Contains files that need processing (like SCSS)
- **archetypes**: Contains content templates

## Simple Customization Methods

Here are some ways to customize your theme without modifying the theme files directly:

1. **Override templates** - Create a file with the same path in your site's layouts directory
2. **Custom CSS** - Add your own CSS file to static/css/
3. **Site configuration** - Modify parameters in your config file (hugo.toml)
4. **Content organization** - Structure your content to match your needs

## Advanced Customization

For more advanced customization:

- Create partial templates
- Use Hugo pipes for asset processing
- Create shortcodes for reusable content
- Modify taxonomy templates

Remember to test your changes locally before deploying to production!
